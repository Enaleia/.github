## Welcome to the Enaleia GitHub repository. ðŸ‘‹
Enaleia is an organisation with a vision to make the marine ecosystem sustainable through circular and social economy solutions. Enaleia runs several projects worldwide, from mega cleanup projects to consultancy & research projects.

You can learn more about our mission at: [https://enaleia.com/](https://enaleia.com/)

## Project Overview
Enaleia works with fishing communities in the Mediterranean, mobilising them on sustainable fishing practices and incentivising them to bring their plastic bycatches back to the port. Joining forces with certified recycling and upcycling partners, the collected marine plastic is integrated into the circular economy.
We are partnering with Pollen Labs to develop a customized public ledger for transparent and secure tracking of plastic collection, transportation, and recycling processes.
