## Welcome to the Enaleia hub. ðŸ‘‹
[Enaleia](https://enaleia.com/) is a well-established social enterprise that collaborates with thousands of fishermen to reduce marine pollution by training them to collect plastic waste while fishing and adopt sustainable practices. To date, they have collected over 1,200 tons of marine plastic, helping clean the Mediterranean and support a circular economy by turning waste into resources. Their efforts have earned multiple awards, including recognition as a UN Champion. Enaleia is a flagship project proudly supported by the Next Billion Fellowship in cohort #4.  

## Project Overview
The Enaleia Hub aims to showcase Enaleiaâ€™s environmental impact using blockchain and the open-source approach. By integrating key features such as reporting, attestation, role management, traceability, and product passports, the Hub will offer a streamlined internal system and a public-facing interface.
